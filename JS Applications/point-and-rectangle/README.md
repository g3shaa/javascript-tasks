<h2>Point and Rectangle Visualization</h2>
This is a simple web application that allows users to input coordinates for a point and a rectangle and visualize their relationship on a canvas.

<h3>Installation</h3>
To run this application, simply clone or download the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. No additional installation is necessary.

<h3>Usage</h3>
The user interface is comprised of two sections: the input container and the output container. In the input container, users can adjust the coordinates of the point and rectangle by moving the sliders. Once the desired coordinates have been set, users can click the "Visualize" button to see the relationship between the point and rectangle displayed on the canvas in the output container.

The output container also displays text indicating whether the point is inside, outside, or on the border of the rectangle. The color of the text and the background changes depending on the relationship between the point and rectangle.
